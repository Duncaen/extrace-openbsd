NAME
     extrace – trace exec() calls system-wide

SYNOPSIS
     extrace [-deflq] [-o file] [-p pid | cmd ...]

DESCRIPTION
     extrace traces all program executions occurring on a system.

     The options are as follows:

     -d      Print the current working directory of the new process.

     -e      Print environment of process, or ‘-’ if unreadable.

     -f      Generate flat output without indentation.  By default, the line
             indentation reflects the process hierarchy.

     -l      Resolve full path of the executable.  By default, argv[0] is
             shown.

     -q      Suppress printing of exec(3) arguments.

     -o file
             Redirect trace output to file.

     -p pid  Only trace exec(3) calls descendant of pid.

     cmd ...
             Run cmd ... and only trace descendants of this command.

             By default, all exec(3) calls are traced globally.

EXIT STATUS
     The extrace utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
